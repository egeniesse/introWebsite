		<h1>Hello... My name is Hans Gruber, and I am an <i>exceptional</i> thief.</h1>
		(Actually, it's Jess Yang, but pretending to be an international terrorist is much more interesting.)

		<h2>I was born in Germany and take full credit as the mastermind behind the <a href="http://diehard.wikia.com/wiki/Nakatomi_Plaza"target="_blank">Nakatomi Plaza</a> heist.</h2>

		(I was actually born in Taiwan but raised in the Bay Area. Die Hard was a movie that really resonated with me when I was a kid. I still like action flicks, but enjoy dramas such as Breaking Bad and House of Cards much more.)
		<p>
		(I like spending some of my spare time in the backyard learning plant propagation through trial and error. But sometimes, I wished I was a terrorist so I can blow up stuff like Hans.)
